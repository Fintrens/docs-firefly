#  The World of Quantitative Trading
Welcome to the world of quantitative trading, where the art of financial decision-making
meets the power of computer algorithms. Quantitative trading, also known as algorithmic
trading, involves the execution of securities trades based solely on buy/sell decisions
made by computer algorithms. These algorithms are carefully designed and programmed
by Users, leveraging historical financial data to develop and test trading strategies.

## Unveiling the Distinction: Quantitative Trading vs. Technical Analysis
Quantitative trading goes beyond the realm of traditional technical analysis. While
technical analysis strategies can be part of a quantitative trading system if they can be
fully translated into computer programs, not all technical analysis techniques fit this
criterion. Certain subjective chartist methods may not qualify as quantitative trading due
to their lack of quantifiability.

## The Business Case for Quantitative Trading
Starting a quantitative trading business offers a blend of excitement, intellectual
stimulation, and potential financial rewards. It presents scalability advantages, allowing
gradual growth without the need for extensive external funding. As you gain confidence
and profitability, your trading capacity can increase exponentially.

## Efficiency and Time Management
Quantitative trading is highly automated, minimizing the day-to-day time commitment
required. With efficient automation, users can remotely monitor their systems and
occasionally intervene as necessary. Engaging in research and backtesting for new
strategies adds a creative dimension to the business and can be managed at one's
convenience.

## Boundless Possibilities
As technology continues to advance, quantitative trading becomes increasingly
streamlined. The goal is to achieve self-sustaining operations that require minimal time
and effort while generating steady profits. This allows users to enjoy their leisure time or
explore other business endeavors confidently.
