Firefly Bot incorporates automatic stop loss and takes profit orders for every trade
executed. These orders are set at predetermined levels, enabling timely exit from trades
to limit potential losses and secure profits. The disciplined use of stop loss and take profit
orders helps in maintaining a structured and risk-controlled trading approach.
